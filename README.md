# Nuxeo CloudBinaryManager

This addon provides implementations of Nuxeo's BinaryManager that stores binaries in cloud storage services.
Currently there are two implementations available:

- Amazon S3 storage: http://aws.amazon.com/s3/

- Scality storage: http://www.scality.com/

For efficiency, a local disk cache (with limited size) is also used.

## S3 configuration

To configure the S3 addon you will need a custom template including a modified
default-repository-config.xml file with the following line:

    <binaryManager class="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.storage.sql.S3BinaryManager" />
in the innermost "repository" section.

You will also need to make some additions to your nuxeo.conf file:

*Be sure to protect your nuxeo.conf readable only by the nuxeo user as the
file will have your AWS identifiers.*

### Mandatory parameters

- nuxeo.s3storage.bucket : the name of the S3 bucket (unique across all of
  Amazon, find something original!)

- nuxeo.s3storage.awsid : your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

- nuxeo.s3storage.awssecret : your AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY


### Optional parameters

- nuxeo.s3storage.region : the region code your S3 bucket will be placed in.
  For us-east-1 (the default), don't set this parameter
  For us-west-1, use us-west-1
  For eu-west-1, use EU
  For ap-southeast-1, use ap-southeast-1

- nuxeo.s3storage.cachesize : size of the local cache (default is 100MB).

### Crypto parameters

With S3, you have the option to store your data encrypted.
Note that the local cache will *NOT* be encrypted.

The S3 binary manager can use a keystore containing a keypair, but there are
a few caveats to be aware of :

- The Sun/Oracle JDK doesn't always allow the AES256 cipher which the AWS SDK
  uses internally.
  Depending on the US export restrictions for your country, you may be able to
  modify your JDK to use AES256 by installing the "Java Cryptography Extension
  Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files". See the following link to
  download the files and installation instructions:
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

- Don't forget to specify the key algorithm if you create your keypair with the
  "keytool" command, as this won't work with the default (DSA).
  The S3 Binary Manager has been tested with a keystore generated with this
  command :
       keytool -genkeypair -keystore </path/to/keystore/file> -alias <key alias>
      -storepass <keystore password> -keypass <key password>
      -dname <key distinguished name> -keyalg RSA

With all that preceded in mind, here are the crypto options (they are all
mandatory once you specify a keystore) :

- nuxeo.s3storage.crypt.keystore.file : the absolute path to the keystore file
- nuxeo.s3storage.crypt.keystore.password : the keystore password
- nuxeo.s3storage.crypt.key.alias = the key alias
- nuxeo.s3storage.crypt.key.password = the key password


## Scality configuration

To configure the Scality addon you will need a custom template including a modified
default-repository-config.xml file with the following line:

    <binaryManager class="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.storage.sql.ScalityBinaryManager" />
in the innermost "repository" section.

You will also need to make some additions to your nuxeo.conf file:

### parameters
*Be sure to protect your nuxeo.conf readable only by the nuxeo user as the
file will have your Scality identifiers.*


- nuxeo.scality.awsid - your Scality identifier
- nuxeo.scality.awssecret - your Scality passphrase
- nuxeo.scality.region - preferred storage region (e.g. US)
- nuxeo.scality.bucket - the name of the Scality bucket
- nuxeo.scality.cache.size - size of the local cache (e.g. 100MB)
- nuxeo.scality.host.name - the hostname on the Scality system
